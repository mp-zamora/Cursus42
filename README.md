# 42 Cursus Repository
Welcome to my 42 Cursus repository. Here you will be able to find some of the projects I have developed during my attendance to the 42 coding school (Madrid campus).

## About 42
42 has a unique peer-to-peer pedagogic approach, where students learn in the absence of professors or formal academic methods. Instead, it relies in the self-taught ability of its students and the collaboration between peers to learn trough hands-on projects.
This special approach is what makes 42 unique, and has helped me to develop not only hard skills related to ComSci, but also essential soft skills useful in the workplace. Some of these skills include teamworking, problem solving and autonomous organization.

### About coding rules
At the school we follow some special rules called 'the norm'. These are in place to teach us how to code in a clean way. Moreover, our programs can't have memory leaks or end in unexpected ways, which is a standard practice in C programming as well.

### About project evaluation
The projects we develop at the school must be evaluated by three peers. During the evaluations, the project author must defend their creation and every choice made to produce that project. This makes coding more exciting, as no shortcuts are allowed and you really shall understand 100% of yoour project.

## About me
I do not attend 42 full time, however I dedicate as much free time as I have to it. I would love to specialize in Cyber Security in the future, however, I first need to complete the common core and keep learning the 'basics'. 42 is a transformative journey which I do not regret starting!
